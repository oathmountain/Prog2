# Prog2

This project was made for a school programming course in Java.
It was made in spring -16 with a classmate.

The asignment was to create a system, with the help of Swing, that allows the user to
open an image and define locations on it with the mouse.

The locations would include an array of options, like categories and descriptions. 
They alse had to be able to be displayed, or hidden, in various states.

The program uses a lot of listeners and Swing components, has both add and delete options,
a search by name function as well as a function that searches an area around a mouse click.

It also have save and load options, and it prompts the user if changes has been made when
the user tries to exit the program.
